# BHCI-capstone

We have implemented 3 steps of our design solution: search input, trial results, and trial details pages.

All of our coding files are located within the src folder:
- the components folder contains templates for features we implemented within the pages such as tabs, progress bars, etc.
- the pages folder contains javascript files for each individual step that outline the content of the page and a crresponding css file that outlines the layout of the page
- App.js and App.css files dynmaically program the screen to show the relevant page
